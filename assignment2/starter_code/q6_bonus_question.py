    Going beyond - implement your own Deep Q Network to find the perfect
    balance between depth, complexity, number of parameters, etc.
    You can change the way the q-values are computed, the exploration
    strategy, or the learning rate schedule. You can also create your own
    wrapper of environment and transform your input to something that you
    think we'll help to solve the task. Ideally, your network would run faster
    than DeepMind's and achieve similar performance!

    You can also change the optimizer (by overriding the functions defined
    in TFLinear), or even change the sampling strategy from the replay buffer.

    If you prefer not to build on the current architecture, you're welcome to
    write your own code.

    You may also try more recent approaches, like double Q learning
    (see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf) or dueling networks 
    (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581), but this would be for extra
    extra bonus points.
